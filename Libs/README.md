DiffPatch is a library used to generate diff files and applying them.
Originally made by [Chicken-Bones](https://github.com/Chicken-Bones/DiffPatch), I [updated it](https://github.com/webmilio/DiffPatch) and changed it to fit my needs.

Webmilio's Commons is a library made by [Webmilio](https://github.com/webmilio/WebmiliosCommons) containing various utilities and QOL modules.
Will eventually be moved into a NuGet package.
